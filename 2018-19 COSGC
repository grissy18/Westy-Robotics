//include the servo library
#include <Servo.h>  

//create a servo object called servo1 
Servo servo1;  


void setup()
{
  //attach servo1 to pin 9 on the Arduino 101
  servo1.attach(9);
}


void loop()
{ 
  //create a local variable to store the servo's position.
  int position;

  // To control a servo, you give it the angle you'd like it
  // to turn to. Servos cannot turn a full 360 degrees, but you
  // can tell it to move anywhere between 0 and 180 degrees.

 // Tell servo to go to 180 degrees, stepping by two degrees
  for(position = 0; position < 180; position += 2)
  {
  // Move to next position
    servo1.write(position);  
     // Short pause to allow it to move
    delay(45);
   
  }

  // Tell servo to go to 0 degrees, stepping by one degree
  for(position = 180; position >= 0; position -= 1)
  { 
    // Move to next position
    servo1.write(position);
    // Short pause to allow it to move
    delay(25);          
  }
